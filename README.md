# AWS Multi-Level Tagging

This repository contains Python Lambda functions for automating AWS resource tagging. It's structured to support a hierarchical tagging approach across different organizational tiers.

## Structure

- `/org`: Contains the Lambda functions to get tag information from Organization.
- `/tag`: Contains the Lambda functions to tag resources in the target account.

## Further Details
